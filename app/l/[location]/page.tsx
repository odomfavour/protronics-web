                  ${state} PCB assembly services offer a unique approach â€“ we
                  provide a few prototype boards on a quick-turn basis, then
                  spread the rest out over 1-2 weeks. This keeps you in debug
                  mode while saving you the expense of getting all your boards
                  in a quick turn.

                Types of EMS Providers?

              <p className="text-base font-normal text-proDark">
                Often there are two types of EMS providers, (HMLV) High Mix Low
                Volume and HVLM (HVLM). A provider is classified as HMLV or HVLM
                based on their output volume, unit built, and the complexity or
                variation of assemblies completed by the provider. Protronics
                specializes in HMLV and HVLM quick-turn PCB assembly.

              <p className="text-base font-normal text-proDark">
                To choose and EMS partner, you should make sure the company has
                the knowledge, equipment, capabilities and a professionally
                trained team to provide a quality finished product, meet your
                product requirements, and turnaround time. Best practice is to
                choose a certified PCB assembly manufacturer and service
                provider, like Protronics to ensure optimal product performance,
                quality and reliability.
